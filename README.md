# XamDiv
A portable and easy to use exam taking device that makes the lives of professors and students easier by streamlining the exam taking process. <br><br>
_[How to setup XamDiv](#installation-and-setup)_

## Functionality
For the XamDiv to work it only needs to be connected to power. Once it is turned on it will automatically fire up the webserver and all other needed processes. The only thing that students and professors need to do is to connect to XamDiv's network using WiFi. Upon connection to the device, <ins>(the default browser will open the website with the URL www.XamDiv.edu.)<ins> <br>

The website has 3 main parts: <br>
The login page, professor page and exam page. <br>

In the **login page** students can write their ID and Exam ID (given by their instructor) to enter the exam. Professors can log in using their username and password. <br>

In the **professor page**, professors can take a look at all of their students submissions.

In the **exam page** students are first prompted with an initial note from the professor, this note can be brought back at any time by the student. <br>
After closing the note, the student can view how much time they have left, a list of questions with their respective marks and notes. The student can change between questions at any time and even minimize/maximize the questions. Each question has its own code editor where the student can write their respective answer. <br>
Depending on the professor, the students might even have access to a compiler which can be used to test for syntax errors (but only for a limited amount of times per question). <br>
When the student is satisfied with their answers they can submit their code by clicking the submit button where they will be prompted with a confirmation dialog box. After confirmation, the exam is submitted and the student can no longer perform any changes to their exam. <br>
If the student leaves the exam at any time by refreshing their tab they lose access to their session.

## Current limitations
Due to time constraints our project has the following limitations:
- The professors can only view submitted exams but not create new ones via the website.
- For creating and starting exams, it is necessary to manually go through the api (it is not implemented within the website).
- Creating an exam with more/less than 5 questions doesn't work.
- The console (compiling the code within the website) works only on Linux and it does not work on Windows (but since everything is hosted on the Raspberry Pi this doesn't matter).

## Technical specification
For creating the project we have used the following technologies: <br>
- **Front-end**: Vue.js, vuetify and axios.
- **Back-end**: Python, fastapi and uvicorn.
- **Webserver**: Nginx.
- **Operating system**: Manjaro.
- **Server**: Raspberry Pi.

## Installation and setup
**Requirements:**
- Python v3.11.4
- Node.js v20.3.0

**Installing the needed Python libraries:** <br>
`pip install fastapi` <br>
`pip install uvicorn` <br>

**Installing the needed Node.js packages:** <br>
`cd front-end` <br>
`npm install` <br>

**How to run the back-end:** <br>
`cd back-end/src` <br>
`uvicorn app:app --reload` <br>

**How to run the front-end:** <br>
`cd front-end` <br>
`npm run serve` <br>

**_Note:_** For the above listed commands you have to be in the main directory of the project. <br>

**How to create a new exam:** <br>
To be able to enter an exam as a student, the exam must first be created from the back-end. <br>
1. Start by running the back-end. <br>
2. Afterwards go to **localhost:8000/docs**, there you will find **/api/makeExam** where you will be prompted to create an exam. <br>
3. After creating an exam you will also have an **ExamID**, this ID is needed to log in as a student/professor. <br>

**_Note:_** In the **studentsIds** variable you have to delimit each student ID using commas, and in the **questionsNotesMarks** variable you have to first write a question then a note and then a mark, delimited using the **\`** symbol. <br>
_(Example: "This is question 1\`This is Note 1\`10\`This is question 2\`This is Note 2\`5")_

**How to start an exam:** <br>
After having created an exam you now need to start the exam to be able to enter it. <br>
1. In **localhost:8000/docs** click on **/api/startExam**. <br>
2. In the **Exam_Id** field enter the ExamID which you generated. <br>
3. Using the student IDs which you entered and the ExamID which you generated, you will now be able to log in.
